In this homework, you will write code for a more scaffolded version of Questions 7 and 8 from Case Study 1.

Run the following **R** code to load the data into your RStudio and take a look at it. Note that the Total.Score variable you need later is included as well.

## Summarizing data

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Load dataset
bball = read.csv("http://kbodwin.web.unc.edu/files/2016/06/basketball.csv")

# Look at dataset
head(bball)

# Make new variable
bball$Total.Score = bball$Team.Score + bball$Opponent.Score

```

***

Recall that *t-scores* are used instead of *z-scores* when the population standard deviation is unknown.  The functions `pt` and `qt` work almost same way as `pnorm` and `qnorm`, except that the mean and standard deviation are always 0 and 1, respectively. So to find the area in the t-distribution to the left of t=2.4, for example, you would type `pt(2.4, 17)` if there were 17 degrees of freedom.

### Question 7:
Use all your new **R** skills to answer this question: Was the Feb 17th game between UNC and Duke particularly high scoring *for a UNC game*?

A. The command below creates a subset of bball that includes all games with neutral location and assigns it to the variable Location. Modify this code to get a subset of bball that contains only "North Carolina" as the 'Team' and assign it to the variable UNCGames. Then output UNCGames and you should have 34 of them.

```{r, eval = TRUE}


UNCGames = bball[bball$Team == "North Carolina",]
UNCGames
nrow(UNCGames)

```

B. Now we want to get a vector called UNCTotalScores by grabbing only the Total.Score column from UNCGames. Then output UNCTotalScores to see that you have 34 of the right kind of numbers.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
UNCTotalScores = UNCGames[ , 9]
UNCTotalScores

```

C. From you output in Part A, you can see that the total score of the UNC-Duke game on February 17 was x=147. We will find the t-score for this value using the mean and standard deviation of the sample of all 34 UNC games. Recall that when we are drawing one value at a time: t = (x-xbar)/s. 

In the code box below, find the mean and standard deviation of the total scores for UNC games, assign those values to `xbar` and `se` and output those calculated values.. Then calculate and ouput the value of t.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
xbar <- mean(UNCTotalScores)
se = sd(UNCTotalScores)


```

D. ***Using the t-distribution***, estimate the proportion of all UNC games that have a total score less than that of the UNC-Duke game in question. What is your conclusion, was this a particularly high-scoring game? Explain in an answer box that you create. (Note that there are theoretical problems with our approach here. We will discuss them in class.)

```{r, eval=TRUE} 
#Your code here
x = 147
t = (x-xbar)/se
print(t)
p = pt(t, 33)
print(p)


```

```
So about 39% of all UNC scores are below 147. Since about 61% of UNC scores are higher than this game's, we can conclude it is not a particularly high scoring game
```

## Confidence Intervals and Proportions

You now have all the **R** knowledge you need to make some confidence intervals.  You may wish to go over your lecture notes for this section, especially to remind yourself how to deal with proportions.

***

### Question 8:
In this question, you will construct a 95% confidence interval for the number of points UNC scores in a given game.

A. Make a variable called UNCScores by grabbing only the Team.Score column from the table `UNCGames' that you made earlier. Go ahead and output UNCScores to check your work.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
#YOUR CODE HERE

UNCScores = UNCTotalScores = UNCGames[ , 5]
UNCScores

```


B. Make a 95% confidence interval for the number of points UNC scores in a given game.  You will need to use `qt(proportion,df)` with the right proportion and degrees of freedom to get the critical value of the *t*-distribution. Call the endpoints of the distribution `Upper` and `Lower` and output both values.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
#I am leaving this one to you! 
#You will need to calculate s, xbar, t* and put them together
# with the right formula.

xbar2 <- mean(UNCScores)
se2 = sd(UNCScores)
t2 = qt(0.975,33)
print(t2)



#Upper <- 'Point-estimate + MOE'
#Lower <-

Upper = xbar2 + se2*t2
Lower = xbar2 - se2*t2

print(Upper)
print(Lower)

```

##Question 9:
A readable explanation of ANOVA for difference of means has been placed on the Resources tab of Sakai. Please read it.

##Questions 10-12 
These will be done on paper and are posted in a Word document along with this assignment.
