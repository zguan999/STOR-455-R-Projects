## Data Chicks

Thus data is available in the package datasets
```{r datasets}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

Let us analyze the data first

```{r}
summary(ChickWeight)
lm_fit1=lm(weight~Time+Diet,data=ChickWeight)
summary(lm_fit1)
plot(lm_fit1)
```

Notice heterohgeneity of variance. Try transformations

```{r}
require('MASS')
out=boxcox(lm_fit1,lambda=seq(-2,2,1/100))
out$x[which(out$y==max(out$y))]
```

We can try log transformation $\lambda=0$ 
```{r}
lm_fit2=lm(log(weight)~Time+Diet,data=ChickWeight)
summary(lm_fit2)
plot(lm_fit2)
```
or even $\lambda=-.19$.
```{r}
lm_fit3=lm(weight^(-.19)~Time+Diet,data=ChickWeight)
summary(lm_fit3)
plot(lm_fit3)
```
